The second month is over and I made really good progress. The design is now
added and it is possible to play, rate and search videos. Only a couple of
things are missing to put a first beta online.

One of the most important things this week will be to upload nearly 1.000
signs. With that amount of videos the beta should already be usable. As
mentioned in the last blogpost I will focus on the core feature of this site
after that: the recording of new signs using your webcam.

Keep your fingers crossed that I can keep up this speed.
