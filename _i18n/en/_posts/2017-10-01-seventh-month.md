This month we finally added new features to SignDict. Let's start
with the most important one. Thanks to [Laurens](https://github.com/laurens)
it is now possible to add new signs using Firefox. You need to have the lastest
Firefox Version 56 installed. Older versions have a bug in processing videodata.
Please try it out and [add a new word](https://signdict.org/entry/new).

The second big feature are lists. Do you want to learn [all german
weekdays](https://signdict.org/list/1-alle-wochentage)?  Or [all
months](https://signdict.org/list/2-alle-monate)? Now you can find them all in
a nice list. If you have ideas for more lists, please post them in the
[forum](https://community.signdict.org/). With over 4.000 signs I can't do that
work on my own. For the near future it is planned that everyone can create
their own lists and share them with others. For example to have a list of new
vocabulary learned in a sign language course.

Are you a software developer and able to write Javascript or Elixir? This
month you can get a T-Shirt working on OpenSource during the
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). If you want to
work on SignDict, feel free to browse through the 
[tickets](https://github.com/signdict/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest).
If you have another great idea feel free to create a new ticket to start
a discussion.

I am currently searching for CODAs (children of deaf adults) working in the
Belrin tech scene. I would love to exchange experiences and get more connected.
Please [contact me](https://signdict.org/contact). Thanks.
