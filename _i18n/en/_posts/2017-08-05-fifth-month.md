The most important todo in the last month was
the removal of the word "beta". The page is now
stable enough and has all the features I wanted
in the 1.0 version. The recording works and SignDict
is slowly getting more visitors.

One of the new features I added last month was the
new video player. With it you can now reduce the playback
speed to better understand the hand movements. Aside from all
the development I talked to a lot of people to promote
the site. The reaction was an article on [hoergeschaedigt.de](https://www.hoergeschaedigte.com/index.php/2017/07/18/gebaerdensprache-was-ist-signdict/)
and lots of tweets and facebook posts. For example by
[Leidmedien](https://twitter.com/leidmedien/status/892664243098722304).

It would be awesome if you helped me by sharing the site on Twitter
and Facebook, too. I would be really happy about every tweet and
post.

The last month was sadly the last one I could work
full time on SignDict. From now on forward I will work
on it in my spare time. I started a new Job on the 1st
of august. But don't worry. There are a lot of items
on my todo list that I will work on in the next couple
of months.
