As mentioned in [the last update](/en/2017/11/05/eighth-month.html)
I did a small baby break. Now I am back with news about SignDict:

## API

We now have an API. This means software developers can now
query for videos and use them in their own little projects.
To my knowledge this is a first. No other sign dictionary offers
this. Thanks to [Jan](https://github.com/jann) for his hard work on it. 
More details can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/signdict/website/wiki/API).

## The documentation project

After we finished the basic functionality of SignDict, we will now focus on the
next big topic: educate people about sign language. The aim is not to replace
a language course, but to give a good overview about the language. Hopefully
this will be a good starting point to learn sign language in the near future.
At first we will focus on german sign language and the documentation will be
in german, too. If this is successful, we can try to offer this in other
languages.

You can now find a first version of it at [docs.signdict.org](http://docs.signdict.org).
There is a lot to be done. Most importantly: adding more pages. If you are
fluent in German and want to help me out, please [contact](https://signdict.org/contact)
me. I am searching for people with enough knowledge in german sign that are
interested in creating the best introduction to the beautiful world of sign
language.
