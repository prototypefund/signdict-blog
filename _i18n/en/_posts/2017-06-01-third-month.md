The third month went faster than I thought.

I can now proudly present you the beta of the site.
Open [beta.signdict.org](https://beta.signdict.org)
and you will find over 4.000 German signs. If you never
got in contact with the german sign language you might
wonder why some words have several sign variants attached
to them. These are different dialects. Everyone can "like"
for the variant they are familiar with. In the end
this will make it possible to always show the most
common variant on top.

Please try out the page and [tell me](http://beta.signdict.org/contact)
what you think about it.

You won't find the webcam functionality in this beta yet. I started
working on it 2 weeks ago. Hopefully I can tell you more
about that in the next month.
