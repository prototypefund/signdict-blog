This week the six month of working with the Prototype Fund finally ended.

On Thursday every project could present their work of the last months during
the closing event. It wasn't that easy to pack everything that happend
in the last 6 month into a 5 minute presentation, but I think it worked.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/bitboxer">@bitboxer</a> is presenting his awesome tool <a href="https://twitter.com/signdict">@signdict</a> A sign language wiki 0x1f44c<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/prototypedemos?src=hash">#prototypedemos</a> <a href="https://t.co/nFmz25ftWE">https://t.co/nFmz25ftWE</a> <a href="https://t.co/DsLwn8hZze">pic.twitter.com/DsLwn8hZze</a></p>&mdash; Julia Kloiber (@j_kloiber) <a href="https://twitter.com/j_kloiber/status/903239904527867905">August 31, 2017</a></blockquote>

This was also a great opportunity to meet everyone from the first and second
round of the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de). Currently the
registration for the third round is open. If you have an Idea for an OpenSource
project and want to earn 47.500â‚¬ for 6 month of work, apply now!

As already mentioned in the last post this month was also the first month of my
new full time job. Sadly I didn't manage to add new features to SignDict
because of that. Instead I talked with a lot of people about potential
improvements to SignDict.

In the next half year I want to concentrate to make SignDict better for people
who want to use it as a teaching tool. If you are a teacher for Sign Language,
please [contact me](https://signdict.org/contact). I would love to talk to you
about your needs.
