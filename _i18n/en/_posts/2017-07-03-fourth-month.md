The last four weeks I was busy working on the webcam recording
functionality. It is ready now and if you want to beta test it,
please send [me a message](https://beta.signdict.org/contact).
The only thing you need is a webcam and the Chrome browser. Sadly
there is a bug in Firefox that will be fixed in version 55.

If everything works fine I will activate this for everyone. From
that point on everyone will be able to add new signs to the
dictionary. I am really curious how many of you will participate.

The next four weeks will be the last I will work full time on SignDict.
The main focus will be polishing the recording functionality and working
on smaller functions that will increase the usage experience of the page.
After that I will work on SignDict in my spare time.

I nearly forgot a small thing that was added last month:
the [alphabetical list](https://beta.signdict.org/entry).

Have fun exploring the list!
