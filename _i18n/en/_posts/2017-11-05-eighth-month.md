This month I startet to slow down the development on
SignDict. I will have other important private things
in the next couple of months. After that I will start
posting updates again. The next one will hopefully
be in spring. Till then I will continue to add
new lists. For example
[numbers](https://signdict.org/list/11-zahlen) and
[countries](https://signdict.org/list/5-l%C3%A4nder).

If you haven't heard already: Apple released a new
Version of MacOS and iOS that includes [240 new Emojis](https://blog.emojipedia.org/ios-11-1-emoji-changelog/).
One of them is the "[I love you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILY_sign)" sign ðŸ¤Ÿ.
