The first month is over now. The data model is done, the user sign up
and the admin pages coded and the server configured. Thanks to
[rrbone.net](https://rrbone.net) for donating the server ðŸ˜˜.

One other big todo is also done. [Zweitag](https://zweitag.de) created a design and the logo
for signdict. Working together with them was really enjoyable. Here is
a little preview of the design:

Besides the help by rrbone and zweitag I also got help coding a few
things by Tobias and Jan. I am still overwhelmed by the amount of help
I am getting from everyone ðŸŽ‰. A big thank you for that from me!

The next step is to implement the design. I hope by the end of next
month you will be able to see videos on the page. If everything works
out as planned I will work on the video recording and uploading from
May on.
