# What is SignDict?

This project will be an open sign language dictionary. A sign missing, or you
know another sign for the word? Record and add it with one click.

This project is funded by the [Prototype Fund](http://prototypefund.de). Start
of development is the 1st of March 2017.

# Who is the target audience?

This dictionary is aimed at people already fluent and to learners. It will be
a dictionary and learning aid and wants to raise the awareness of sign language
in the public space.

# Why do we need this?

The goal is to create the first interactive sign language dictionary in which
everyone can participate in without any technical knowledge.

If you search for online sign language dictionaries, you will find lots of
them. Sadly most have a few hundred words and don't allow to add new signs.
Additionally only a few show more than one sign for a word. I want to try to
have as many sign variations for a word as possible.

This lead to the idea to crowdsource the dictionary. Everyone can participate
and add a sign. Most computers nowadays have a webcam with a quality that is
sufficient to record sign language. Together we as the sign language community
can build an interactive dictionary. One that has as many signs as possible.
At the beginning the dictionary will only have the german sign language (DGS),
but we will add more languages as we grow.

# Why do you build this?

I am a [CODA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_of_deaf_adult), a child of
deaf adults. Since I started to see videos appear online, I was dreaming of a
service like this. In 2013 I wrote [a proof of
concept](http://bitboxer.de/2013/10/25/see-me-speak/) with a few friends during
a hackathon. One of the learnings back then was that the web technology was not
good enough at that time to do it as good as I wanted. Luckily those problems
are solved now and I can start building it.
